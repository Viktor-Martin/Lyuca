# Lyuca
Lyuca is a bot that's been a hobby project of mine since 2019. 


### What's Lyuca for?
Nothing. I just felt like starting to learn JS in 2019, so I started Lyuca to teach myself. Lyuca has most basic features like muting, banning and kicking. 
As well as a basic level system that I did NOT rip off of mee6 because of my extreme hatred for the devs of mee6. Other than the basics, he has a few unique things
but nothing really of note. Like I said, just a fun little project I've been working on from time to time because I just enjoy programming.


### Installation
If you ever felt like installing Lyuca to host yourself for some reason, these are the steps you'd need to take.

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Go to Discord's [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create an application.
- After creating your application, download the source file however you'd like.
- From there, open a terminal to the root directory of the file and run `npm init -y`
The `-y` is optional, it just accepts the default values of the initalization.
- After that run `npm i` or `npm install` to install the dependencies from the package.json.
- In the root directory, create a `.env` file and add the line `TOKEN=yourToken`
- Finally, run `npm lyuca.js`

I'm really tired, it's 10 am and I haven't slept, so I'm probably missing something, but ain't nobody gonna read this anyway. 

Oh, and if you want to use e6, you'll need to get your own e6 api key.
